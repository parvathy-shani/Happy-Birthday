program.

Energy management
------------------
3 Basic approaches for minimizing energy
- Reduce use by downsizing/eliminiating an end-use
- Increase efficiency
- Substitute energy form aka fuel switching

Energy management principles
------------------------------
Principle                      | Relative Cost | Relative Time | Relative Complexity | Relative Benefit

Reivew historical energy usage | Low            | 1 year        |  Low                | 5 - 10 %
Energy audits                  | Low            | 1 year        |  Low                | 5 - 10 %
House keeping and maintenance  | Low            | 1 year        |  Low                | 5 - 15 %
Analysis of energy use         | Low - moderate | 1 - 2 year    |  Moderate - high    | 10 - 20 %
More efficient equipment       | Moderate - high| years         |  Moderate - high    | 10 - 30 %
More efficient process         | Moderate - high| years         |  Moderate - high    | 10 - 30 %


Energy Audit
-------------
- Fundamental goal of EM: Least coast and least environmental effect
- As per the Energy Conservation Act of 2001, EA is defined as "the vertification, monitoring and analysis of use of energy including submission of technical report containing recommendations for improving energy efficiency with cost benefit analysis and an action plan to reduce energy consumption
- Minimize energy cost/waste without affecting production and quality
- To minimize environmental effects

Types of EA depends on:
- Function and type of industry
- Depth to which final audit is needed
- Potential and magnitude of cost reduction desired

Classification
- Preliminary Audit
- Detailed Audit

Preliminary Audit Methodologies
- Establish energy consumption in the organization
- Estimate the scope of saving
- Identify the most likely and the easiest area for attention
- Identify the immediate(especially no/low cost) improvements or savings
- Set a reference point
- Identify areas for more detailed study/measurement
- Preliminary energy audit uses existing, or easily obtained data 

Detailed Energy Audit methodolgies
3 phases
i. Pre Audit Phase
ii. Audit Phase
iii. Post Audit Phase


------------------Pre Audit Phase---------------------
Step 1 : - Plan and organise (Resource planning, organize instuments and time frame)
	 - walk through audit (Macro data collection, familiarization of process/plant activities)
	 - Informal interview with energy manager, production/plant manager(First hand observation and assessment of current level operations and practices) 

Step 2 : - Conduct a brief meeting/ awareness programme with all divisional heads and persons concerned(2-3 hours)(Building up cooperation, issue questionnaire for each dept, orientation, awareness creation)

-----------------------Audit Phase-----------------------
Step 3 : - Primary data gathering, process flow diagram and energy utility diagram(Historic data analysis, baseline data collection, prepare flow charts, all service utility system diagram, design, operating data and schedule of operation, annual energy bill and energy consumption pattern)

Step 4 : - Conduct survey and monitoring (Measurements)

Step 5 : - Conduct of detailed trials/experiments for selected energy guzzler(Trails/experiments: 24hr power monitoring,load variations in pumps)

Step 6 : - Analysis of energy use(Energy and material balance, energy loss/waste analysis)

Step 7 : - Identification and development of energy conservation opportunities

Step 8 : - Cost benefit analysis

Step 9 : - Reporting and presentation to the top management

------------------Post Audit Phase---------------------
Step 10 - Implementation and follow-up

Energy management opportunities in Lighting system
--------------------------------------------------
Overall energy consumption in commercial building 2012 - 10% lighting
- Energy efficient equipment
- Careful desgin
- Effective control

EM opportunities
- Ligthing controls
- Replace T12 tubes with T8
- Replace mercury light with metal hallide/high pressure sodium light
- Replace metal hallide with high intensity fluroscent lights
- Replace magnetic ballast with electronic ballast
- Optimization of plant lighting in production & non production department
- Optimum use of natural sunlight

Installation of CFLs in place of incandescent lamps
- use 2/3 less energy than standard incandscent bulbs and can last 6 - 10 time longer, give the same amount of light
